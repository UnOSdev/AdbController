# AdbController


This script is just for lazy people who dont want to write long commands in adb.

So far, this script has quite a bit of functionality, but this is just the first version.

Download 'ADBcontroller.py'

NOTE: You must have adb installed, this script is not the 'small version of adb'.
If you find any bug, well contact me for it

Ù‹Work function list:

  Stop App/Service: 'stop'
  
  All packages list: 'list'
  
  Open application: 'open'
  
  Restart device: 'reboot' 
  
  Apps activity: 'monitor'
  
  Clear the app data: 'clear'
  
  Delete the package/app/service: 'delete'
  
  Take THE FULL information about the package/app/service : 'fullinfo'
  
  Package's used apk's: 'apkpath' 

The script absolutely does not need superuser or root rights.
The only thing you need is to enable USB debugging on you'r android phone.
