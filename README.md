# AdbController


This program can control your android phone by ADB module, without root.

So far, this script has quite a bit of functionality, but this is just the first version.

Download 'ADBcontroller.py'

NOTE: This program tested on Linux(Elementart OS), but dont worry its working in Windows too, you need just take "ADBcontroller.py" to adb directory and run it.
If you find any bug, well contact me for it

Ù‹Work function list:

  Stop App/Service: 'stop'
  
  All packages list: 'list'
  
  Open application: 'open'
  
  Restart device: 'reboot' 
  
  Apps activity: 'monitor'
  
  Clear the app data: 'clear'
  
  Delete the package/app/service: 'delete'
  
  Take THE FULL information about the package/app/service : 'fullinfo'
  
  Package's used apk's: 'apkpath' 
  
  Install '.apk' package from 'apks' folder: 'install'

The script absolutely does not need superuser or root rights.
The only thing you need is to enable USB debugging on you'r android phone.
